  //Level One Room Descriptions
  public static final String BRIG = "You walk into the brig, a small room on these kind of ships but just big enough to house " +
          "you for your trip. There's not much in here really, but it's served you just fine.";
  public static final String HALLWAY = "You walk into a hallway, a light flickers from the ceiling proving a dim view " +
          "of your surroundings. Being a service hallway in the bowels of a ship, there's still not a lot here, but there" +
          " are a few bits and bobs lying around and a service bot you mentally called jimbo due to his apparent drawl." +
          " There are three doorways, one straight ahead of you to the WEST, and one either side of you to the NORTH and SOUTH.";

          "maybe jimbo knows what is actually useful in here.";
  public static final String LOCKER_ROOM = "This room has lockers in it. Ever since the ship got refitted for public use, these" +
          " lockers are reserved for staff only, but since most of the staff are now bots, pickings are slim.";
  public static final String OFFICE = "You see an office. It's a bare fitted affair, presumably used for keeping staff records " +
          "and processing brig inhabitants, but the last record you can find on it is dated at least 42 years ago." +
          " There's also the vent on the north wall that you used to get back here, but jimbo very helpfully " +

  //Level Two Room Descriptions
  public static final String HALLWAY_TWO = "A basic hallway, there's some notices on the wall about ship etiquette and cleaning up after your self, " +
          "but you suspect no one has read them in years.";

  public static final String LOUNGE = "This counts as a lounge, but the only thing that counts as furniture is a broken sofa with a vagrant on it." +
          " The vagrant seems to hopefully be passed out, but finding out might draw attention to you";

  public static final String BUNKS = "A room full of bunks serving as beds, but they're barely bare metal sheets. A couple of legitimate passengers " +
          "are using them, but keeping a low profile might be best. One of the passengers eyes you in a way you can't figure out...";

  public static final String KITCHEN = "A barren but functional kitchen. The nutrient heaters 'work', but often just make the centre of your food " +
          "hot and whatever it's on, surrounded by a half-frozen shell. Most people prefer to cook using heating vents. There is also a fridge in the corner, " +
          "usually used for food.";

  public static final String ACCESSWAY = "A passage to access further into the ship. There's a door to the NORTH and stairway to the EAST, but it's " +
          "locked behind a keycard scanner reserved for authorised personnel.";

  public static final String STORAGE = "A storage room, for dust apparently.";

  public static final String BATHROOM = "You enter a perfectly normal and clean bathroom.";

  public static final String FOYER = "you enter into a foyer, a surprisingly nice room for this ship. It has furniture and tables and even has fabric on the floor.";

  public static final String FIRST_MATE_ROOM = "you wander into a well furnished room with a four poster princess bed, every corner of the room seems buried in sparkly stuffed unicorns.";

  public static final String HANGER = "you enter a large hanger. There's a desk covered in books and papers, a greasy puddle and most importantly, several ever so slightly " +
          "rusty escape pods line the northern wall, and a status screen for flight viability and fuel status.";

  public static final String CAPTAIN_ROOM = "you enter into the captains room, or at least it used to be when a captain was actually needed. The once pleasant furnishings has become worn and grey, " +
          "and faded notes litter the desk.";

  public static final String FUEL_ROOM = "a dank room, containing shelves of fuel canisters, some of which even have fuel in them.";

  public static final String ESCAPE_POD = "its a creaky old coffin, with a navigation system that can barely run Doom, despite evidence of multiple attempts to do so, but if it can get you off the ship, you'd blast off in a bin";
